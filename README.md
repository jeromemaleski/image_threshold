# image_threshold
This app lets user upload an RGB picture and select a threshold to mask pixels.
It returns a count of masked and unmasked pixels.

This was for a project to estimate shade. 
Take a picture of the sky under obstruction (trees).
This app will threshold the brightest pixels so you can estimate relative amount of sky pixels vs obstructions.
